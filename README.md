# ascentUsersPY
This is a public Workfront Inc. repo for CORE TSE's that will allow the TSE to pull down python code that will automate the process of adding users to HUB for Ascent. These .py files will read the excel file given to us by the customer and then create the users in HUB. After that, the TSE will run the verifyUser.py code to verify all the newly created users with a permanent password that will take place the previously used verification step. Instructions for code can be found here: {help article not yet written}. Instructions to download required packages for macOS: {not yet listed}
